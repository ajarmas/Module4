            <h2>Freelance Graphic Designer & Illustrator</h2>

            <p>Hi there, my name is Andrew J. Armas. Iâ€™m currently in my last year at Wake Technical Community College to complete my Associates in Graphic Design and Advertising. My goal is to become a freelance graphic designer with work that embraces a sense of drama, purpose, and an innate understanding of the impact visuals can have on an audience. I aim to provide professional services (branding, logo design & packaging design, website design, artwork, and illustrations) to small businesses, entrepreneurs, and other clients who need a fresh perspective, ensuring that each creation resonates authentically with their intended audience.</p>
